  <h1>Rent vs Buy Opportunity Cost Calculator</h1>
  <p>
    This is an opportunity cost calculator. It assumes that both the renter and the buyer spend the exact same amount of
    money and compares the opportunity cost of buying vs renting.
    The comparison is input equated based on the annualised cost of ownership, so the rental investment amounts are
    calculated as annual cost of ownership minus rent.
    <br><br>
    Here are a few other things to consider:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Owning ties up most/all wealth in a single asset and single asset class.</li>
    <li>Owning removes all liquidity.</li>
    <li>Investing in USA based index tracker (S&P 500) hedges against local currency devaluation.</li>
    <li>This calculator doesn't take into account the cost, time, and effort of buying or selling a property.</li>
    <li>This does take into consideration renovations, averaged into the maintenance percentage.</li>
    <li>A renter will always pay rent (this is factored in), whereas once the homeloan is paid off, the homeowner will
      only need to pay maintenance, insurance, rates/taxes, levies (if applicable), and management fees (if applicable).</li>
    <li>Defaults are based on my apartment in Tamboerskloof, Cape Town.</li>
